//! Day 22: Dawn of the day before the day before the final day
//!
//! When Christmas Eve rolls around, it's game time. Santa, decked out in his
//! jolly red suit, strides over to his fully-stacked sleigh. His eyes twinkle
//! as he checks his list one last time on his high-tech sleigh dashboard. The
//! backend has been working like a charm after the recent upgrades.
//!
//! With a crack of his whip and a hearty "Ho ho ho," off they go into the snowy
//! night. The reindeers take off like an orange space rocket, disappearing into
//! the starry sky, on a journey to deliver joy to the world!
//!
//! # Task 1: Leave no gift behind!
//!
//! During a last minute database migration in the gift order database, Santa
//! noticed that a small de-sync happened. One gift order slipped through the
//! cracks and only ended up in one of the database replicas. Since it's already
//! Dec 22nd, Santa tells you we need to recover the lost record immediately. No
//! child must be left without a gift this Christmas!
//!
//! When Santa started extracting all gift order IDs from the database replicas,
//! something got jumbled up and caused them to print in a random order.
//! Great... now we have two long lists of random numbers with just one number
//! differing between them. Santa knows you are good at coding, so he
//! concatenates the two files, scrambles the order again and lets you find the
//! integer without a pair.
//!
//! Make a POST endpoint `/22/integers` that takes in a text body with one
//! positive `u64` integer on each line. All integers appear twice, except for
//! one. Find it and respond with a string consisting of that number of Present
//! emojis (游꾸).
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```not_rust
//! curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/22/integers \
//!   -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
//!   -d '888
//! 77
//! 888
//! 22
//! 77
//! '
//!
//! 游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸
//! ```
//!
//! # Task 2: The Shuttle Rocket
//!
//! When Santa speeds across Earth to deliver presents, he looks up to the skies
//! and sees the Shuttle Rocket taking off to the stars. The crew on the rocket,
//! in their quest to visit the stars at the edge of the CCH23 galaxy, has
//! discovered that some magical portals have opened near every star. The
//! portals allow instant bidirectional travel between stars. This saves the
//! crew a lot of flight time to the outer edge, but now they need to figure out
//! which portals to take in order to get to the destination.
//!
//! The input is sent as text in a POST request to `/22/rocket` in this format:
//!
//! * The first line has a number N (`2 <= N <= 100`), the number of stars in the galaxy.
//! * On the following N lines are the 3D coordinates of each star in the galaxy as three `i32s`.
//! * Then follows a line with the number K (`1 <= K <= 100`), the number of portals in the galaxy.
//! * On the following K lines are the stars that each portal connects as two star indices.
//!
//! The crew wants to travel from star *0* to star *N-1* on the path that goes
//! through the least amount of portals, since going through portals make them
//! feel dizzy.
//!
//! After the path with the least portals has been found, the crew wants to know:
//!
//! * How many portals did they have to go through?
//! * How long would the path they took have been if no portals existed? (as an `f32` rounded to 3 decimals)
//!
//! Remember to not get stuck in an infinite portal loop!
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```not_rust
//! curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/22/rocket \
//!   -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
//!   -d '5
//! 0 1 0
//! -2 2 3
//! 3 -3 -5
//! 1 1 5
//! 4 3 5
//! 4
//! 0 1
//! 2 4
//! 3 4
//! 1 2
//! '
//!
//! 3 26.123
//! ```
//!
//! Explanation:
//!
//! There are 5 stars and 4 portals. We can get from star 0 to star 4 by going
//! through these portals:
//!
//! * portal 0 from star 0 to star 1
//! * portal 3 from star 1 to star 2
//! * portal 1 from star 2 to star 4
//!
//! The path is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4. 3 portals were used. The length of this path
//! without taking any portals would have been `distance(star 0, star 1) +
//! distance(star 1, star 2) + distance(star 2, star 4)` where `distance()` is
//! the distance between two stars.
